Midsphere is an autonomous AI agent that handles any task from a single prompt. Whether you need deep research, a working web app, or automated workflows across 500+ platforms, Midsphere delivers results — not just answers.

## What Makes Midsphere Different

Traditional AI assistants generate text. Midsphere **takes action**. It connects to your tools, writes and runs code, browses the web, and completes multi-step tasks end to end.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

- **Research**: Ask for a competitive analysis and get a structured report with sources, data, and actionable insights — not a vague summary.
- **Build**: Describe an app idea and get a working prototype with a database, authentication, and a deployed URL.
- **Automate**: Set up a workflow that monitors your inbox, extracts key data, and updates a spreadsheet — automatically.

## Getting Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Create Your Account

Head to [platform.midsphere.ai](https://platform.midsphere.ai) and sign up. The Free plan gives you 1 task per week — enough to experience what autonomous AI can do.

### 2. Write Your First Prompt

Be specific about the outcome you want. Instead of "help me with marketing," try:

> "Research the top 5 competitors in the AI agent space, compare their pricing and features, and create a summary table with my recommendations."

Midsphere works best when you describe the **end result**, not the steps.

### 3. Review and Iterate

Midsphere executes the task and presents results. You can refine the output, ask follow-up questions, or chain the results into a new task.

## Choosing the Right Plan

| Plan | Best For | Tasks/Week |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Free** | Trying Midsphere out | 1 |
| **Lite** | Regular personal use | 5 |
| **Pro** | Power users and teams | 15 |

All plans include access to 500+ platform integrations. Pro users get custom MCP support and dedicated E2B sandbox environments.

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be outcome-focused**: Describe what you want delivered, not how to do it
2. **Provide context**: Include relevant URLs, data, or constraints
3. **Use connectors**: Link your tools (Slack, GitHub, Google Sheets) for tasks that span platforms
4. **Schedule recurring tasks**: Pro and Lite plans support scheduled automation
