Benchmarks matter for AI agents. Unlike chatbots evaluated on text quality alone, autonomous agents need to prove they can **complete real-world tasks**. Here's how the major benchmarks work and where Midsphere stands.

## The Benchmarks That Matter

### GAIA (General AI Assistants)

GAIA tests an AI agent's ability to handle multi-step, real-world tasks that require reasoning, web browsing, and tool use. Unlike academic benchmarks, GAIA tasks mirror what actual users ask AI to do.

**Midsphere scores:**
- **Test set**: 70.74%
- **Validation set**: 86%

These scores place Midsphere among the top-performing autonomous agents on GAIA, demonstrating strong performance on tasks that require planning, retrieval, and execution across multiple steps.

### Terminal Bench

Terminal Bench evaluates an agent's ability to operate in a terminal environment — running commands, debugging errors, and completing software engineering tasks. It's the closest benchmark to real-world developer workflows.

**Midsphere score: 35.2%**

Terminal Bench is intentionally difficult. A 35.2% score reflects Midsphere's ability to handle genuine coding tasks including dependency resolution, test execution, and multi-file code changes.

### IMO 2025

The International Mathematical Olympiad benchmark tests advanced mathematical reasoning. Problems require multi-step proofs and creative problem-solving.

**Midsphere score: 5.5/6**

Scoring 5.5 out of 6 on IMO-level problems demonstrates Midsphere's reasoning depth beyond typical AI assistant capabilities.

## Why Benchmarks Don't Tell the Whole Story

Benchmarks are useful for comparison, but they don't capture everything that matters in an AI agent:

- **Integration breadth**: Midsphere connects to 500+ platforms. No benchmark tests this.
- **Reliability on repeat tasks**: Production agents need to work consistently, not just once.
- **User experience**: How easy is it to go from prompt to result?

We publish our benchmark scores transparently because we believe in measurable progress — but we also know that real-world performance is what counts.

## How We Test

All benchmark scores are achieved with Midsphere's production configuration:

- Tuning over agent framework: Complete
- Standard LLM backbone with Midsphere's proprietary orchestration layer
- No benchmark-specific fine-tuning or prompt engineering

These are the same capabilities available to every Midsphere user.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>What is GAIA and why does it matter?</summary>

GAIA (General AI Assistants) is a benchmark developed to test AI agents on real-world, multi-step tasks. Unlike traditional NLP benchmarks, GAIA tasks require browsing the web, using tools, and reasoning across multiple steps — making it a strong proxy for actual agent utility.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How often are benchmark scores updated?</summary>

We re-evaluate benchmark scores with each major release. Our scores page always reflects the current production version of Midsphere.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I reproduce these benchmark results?</summary>

Yes. GAIA and Terminal Bench are publicly available benchmarks. You can run them against Midsphere using the same prompts and evaluation criteria described in the original papers.
